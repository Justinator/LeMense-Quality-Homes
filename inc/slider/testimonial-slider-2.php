              Mark and Shelly made our first home build experience fabulous. It was fun and exciting. They collaborated with us on every aspect of the design and build, providing guidance when we needed it and solutions when we needed them. We couldnâ€™t be more pleased with the outcome.

              LeMense Quality Homes truly delivered a custom home that reflects our style and personalities. They did a great job pairing us with the right suppliers and subcontractors, and maintained transparent communication along the way, enabling us to make smart decisions that actually kept us under budget. Even with some unexpected and harsh weather conditions, our timeline stayed right on track which made scheduling our move a breeze. Thanks Mark and Shelly!

              I am glad to have found Mark LeMense as the builder to construct my new home. Mark is an honest and extremely hardworking individual. Even after we moved in, Mark stood firmly by me especially when I had issues with a fraudulent landscaper that I had selected. It was a pleasure working with Shelly in shopping for the various materials needed. She is an absolute sweetheart. The quality of the house built by Mark is top-notch. I would highly recommend Mark LeMense for anyone that needs a quality builder to build their dream home.
