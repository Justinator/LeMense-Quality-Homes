              It was an amazing experience working with Shelly and Mark at LeMense Quality Homes. They made us feel
              that our needs and satisfaction was their number one priority. Our home is exceptionally well built
              with amazing attention to details which exceeded our expectations. To this day, we still canâ€™t believe
              this is our home.

              We were referred to Mark and Shelly via friends who had a great experience building with the
              LeMenses. As stressful a process as building a home can be, Mark and Shelly made it as stress-free
              and as enjoyable an experience as possible. They were also very transparent in all costs. We not only
              received a beautiful, well-built house, but we also acquired lifetime friends!

              Working with Mark and Shelly was absolutely wonderful! From day one they made every step easy and worry-free. Having Shelly was amazing for someone like myself who is design-challenged. She helped us narrow down our options and keep everything cohesive. Mark and the team of contractors were phenomenal in creating our vision and always willing to make a change. LeMense truly made building a home a dream come true.
